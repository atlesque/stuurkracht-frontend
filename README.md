# Stuurkracht UI

This is the frontend for Stuurkracht.be: a website for sending e-cards to support others in need.

## Technical requirements

The UI uses Nuxt.js as the general UI framework. Nuxt.js is based off Vue.

## How to run

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# For Node.js hosting: build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# For static hosting: generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
